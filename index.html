          <td>The div (division) element is a generic block-level element, most often used to divide page content into blocks. A block element is a page element that starts a new line and has a width equal to the entire page or the parent container.

Youâ€™ll very often see divs used to group related paragraphs, images, headings, and links. For example, a three-paragraph article may be enclosed in a div, and a navigation menu containing links might be enclosed in another div. </td>

        <tr>
          <td class="tag">&lt;span&gt;</td>
          <td>Provide an id with the span in order to reference in CSS using #</td>
          <td>The span element is a generic inline element, typically used to apply styling to a portion of inline content. An inline element does not start a new line and only takes up as much space on the page as its content. Span tags are used on small segments of text, links, images, and other HTML elements that appear inline with the surrounding content.</td>
